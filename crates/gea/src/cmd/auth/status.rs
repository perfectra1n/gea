//! `gea auth status` — who you are on each host, and whether the token still works.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing and both are pinned by tests:
//!
//! * **No token, ever, in any form.** This is the output people paste into bug reports and
//!   screenshots. There is deliberately no `--show-token`; `gea auth token` is the scripting
//!   exit, and it warns when it is about to write a secret into scrollback.
//! * **`--json` exits 0 even when a host fails.** That is `gh`'s behaviour and scripts depend on
//!   it: a machine-readable report of a *failure* is a successful report. Without `--json` the
//!   command reports the failure through the taxonomy, so a shell `if` still works.
