//! Everything a command needs, assembled once.
//!
//! [`Runtime`] is the seam between the global flags and the runtime crate: it resolves the
//! host, finds a credential, builds a [`Client`], and works out where output is going.
//!
//! # The host comes from repository resolution, not from `active`
//!
//! One [`Client`] speaks to one host, and it is built here — so the host has to be *final* here.
//! It therefore comes from [`resolve_repo`], the same call that decides the repository, because
//! the checkout's remotes are part of that decision and `hosts.toml`'s `active` is only its last
//! resort. See the [`gitea_core::context`] module docs for the full precedence.
//!
//! Resolving the host independently of the repository is what this arrangement exists to
//! prevent, and it is not a hypothetical: asking [`Hosts::resolve_host`] directly took the slug
//! from the checkout's remote and the host from `active`, so `gea pr list` in a clone of
//! `code.example/them/proj` sent `GET /repos/them/proj/pulls` to whichever host `gea auth
//! switch` had last selected. The 404 was the *good* case; had that instance held a repository
//! of the same name, the command would have answered confidently about the wrong repository on
//! the wrong server, with `--debug` naming the host it chose and nothing naming the one it was
//! asked about.
//!
//! So resolution is no longer deferred in full. [`Runtime::repo`] keeps its cell — commands that
//! need the repository still ask for it, and the cell is pre-filled here when resolution
//! succeeded, so the `git` subprocesses are spent once rather than twice. The one path that
//! still skips them entirely is an explicit `--host`/`$GEA_HOST`/`$GITEA_HOST`, which outranks
//! anything resolution could find and is how CI names its host.
//!
//! # Warnings are warnings
//!
//! [`Hosts::take_warnings`] and `Credentials::take_warnings` carry problems that are real but
//! survivable: a keyring with no D-Bus session behind it, a `hosts.toml` entry this build does
//! not understand, a mistyped `GEA_CREDENTIAL_STORE`. Those go to stderr through
//! [`crate::exit::warn`] and the command continues. A missing keyring is the *normal* state
//! over SSH, in containers, and in CI — exactly where a CLI runs — so making it fatal would
//! break the tool in its most common environment.
