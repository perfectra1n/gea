//! `gea` — a Gitea command-line client.
//!
//! # The two-phase parse
//!
//! Layer 2 is all 506 API operations as clap commands. Building that tree eagerly would cost
//! thousands of `Arg` allocations on **every** invocation, `gea --version` included: five to
//! twenty milliseconds spent constructing a parser the user will never reach, in a tool whose
//! whole pre-network budget is under twenty-five. So `main` looks at `argv` first:
//!
//! * [`gea_raw::peek`] compares a few `OsStr`s. If the first non-flag word is not `raw` (or its
//!   hidden alias `x`), it returns `None` in nanoseconds, having allocated nothing.
//! * When it does match, only the named subtree is built — twelve group stubs for
//!   `gea raw --help`, one full command for `gea raw repo create-pull-request`.
//! * Everything else goes through the small derive tree.
//!
//! Both roots carry the same global flags, from [`gea::global`]. Layer 2's root is built here
//! rather than by [`gea_raw::build`] for exactly that reason: the globals belong to the binary,
//! and hanging the `raw` subtree off our own root is how they reach it.

// This crate is `publish = false`, so its rustdoc exists for contributors, who read it with
// `--document-private-items`. Module docs here deliberately link to the private helpers they
// describe — that is the useful thing to link to when explaining how a module works — and those
// links resolve under that flag. Suppressing the lint keeps the links navigable rather than
// demoting sixteen of them to inert code spans. The published crates (gitea-core, -model,
// -client) do NOT carry this allow: docs.rs renders no private items, so there a link to one is
// genuinely broken for the only audience that sees it.
