//! Layer 0 and `gea project`, against a real Gitea.
//!
//! # Why none of this can be covered by a `FakeTransport`
//!
//! Everything layer 0 rests on is a fact about Gitea that no specification states, because
//! Projects has no REST API and the routes behind the board UI are not described anywhere. A
//! mock answers with whatever the test author believed, so it agrees with itself by
//! construction — and the whole risk of this layer is that the author's belief is wrong. Four
//! beliefs in particular are load-bearing, and each was wrong at least once while this was being
//! written:
//!
//! * the session cookie is `session` (Gitea's `i_like_gitea`, which most documentation on the
//!   internet names, matches nothing on Gitea);
//! * the web forms take lowercase field names, not the capitalised Go struct fields;
//! * `POST` to a web route with neither `Origin` nor `Sec-Fetch-Site` passes Gitea's
//!   cross-origin protection, so there is no CSRF token to scrape; and
//! * a `303` to `/user/login` — never a `401` — is the only signal that a session has lapsed.
//!
//! These run against the pinned image, which is what turns a Gitea release that changes any of
//! them into a red test rather than a user's bug report. That pin is layer 0's entire safety
//! story: see `docs/layers.md`.
//!
//! # What these caught, and why the fixture alone was not enough
//!
//! These were written before they could run, and the first thing they found was a bug no unit
//! test could have: `gea` stored the **pre-authentication** session id.
//!
//! Gitea's sign-in calls `RegenerateSession`, a session-fixation defence that issues a fresh
//! session id *after* writing the user id, so the response sets the cookie twice — the first
//! anonymous, the second signed in. Reading the first yielded a session that was perfectly
//! valid and perfectly anonymous, so every public route worked and every private one answered
//! **404** rather than a 401 or a redirect. Nothing in the lapsed-session path fired, because
//! the server never said "signed out".
//!
//! That is the shape of bug this file exists for: it needs a real server, a real sign-in, and a
//! *private* repository, and it is invisible to a `FakeTransport` answering whatever the test
//! author believed. It also explains why the captured board fixture did not reveal it — that
//! page was fetched with a session obtained by `curl`, which keeps the last cookie as a browser
//! does.
//!
//! # The environment is built from scratch, deliberately
//!
//! Every command below runs with `GEA_TOKEN` and `GITEA_TOKEN` *removed*. An environment token
//! would satisfy the API half of these commands without the stored web session being consulted
//! at all, and the suite would pass with the feature entirely broken. The same reasoning is
//! written out in `live_oauth.rs`, which found it first.
