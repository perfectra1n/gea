//! The error taxonomy, and the contract every other module codes against.
//!
//! Two rules govern this module, and both are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **Every variant must be renderable into advice.** [`render`] turns an [`ErrorKind`]
//!    into three parts: what happened, the relevant facts, and what to *do* about it. A
//!    test in that module asserts every variant produces a "what to do" section, so a new
//!    variant cannot ship without a remedy.
//! 2. **Never discard a server message.** Gitea's error bodies are inconsistent, but even
//!    an ugly server message beats a generic one. [`classify`] always preserves it.
