//! An HTTP client for the instance's web root, authenticated by cookie.
//!
//! # Why this is not [`crate::http::Client`] with another [`crate::http::Auth`] variant
//!
//! Three reasons, all structural rather than stylistic.
//!
//! **Redirects must not be followed.** A web route's answer to "you are not signed in" is a
//! `303` to `/user/login`, never a `401`. A client that follows redirects turns that into a
//! `200` carrying the login page, so every unauthenticated command would appear to succeed and
//! return HTML nobody asked for. reqwest's redirect policy is fixed per client, so this needs a
//! client of its own — the API client must keep following redirects, because pagination and
//! attachment downloads depend on it.
//!
//! **The credential must be absent, not merely unused.** `Credentials::apply` writes an
//! `Authorization` header for whatever `Auth` it holds. A web client that held one could send a
//! token to a redirect target, and the API token is the more valuable of the two secrets. This
//! type has no `Credentials` field at all, so there is nothing to leak: the same reasoning as
//! [`crate::http::Client::anonymous`], applied by construction.
//!
//! **A session is minted, not attached.** `apply` is a one-header-per-request contract with no
//! room for "and if the server says the session lapsed, get another one and try again". That
//! belongs a layer up, in [`super::session`].
//!
//! # Cross-origin protection
//!
//! Forgejo 16.0.5 (as measured for fjo) guards state-changing web routes with Go's `http.CrossOriginProtection`, which
//! decides from the `Sec-Fetch-Site` and `Origin` headers rather than from a token in the page.
//! A request carrying neither is treated as same-origin or non-browser and is allowed. **This
//! client must therefore never send either header**, which is why it composes its headers
//! explicitly instead of letting a caller pass arbitrary ones into the auth path;
//! `no_browser_headers_are_ever_sent` asserts it.
