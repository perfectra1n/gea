//! `gea auth export --web` and `gea auth import --web` — moving a session between machines.
//!
//! # Why the remember token and not the session cookie
//!
//! The session lapses in about a day (`SESSION_LIFE_TIME`, 86400 by default). Exporting that
//! alone gives a CI job that works this afternoon and fails tomorrow — the worst failure shape,
//! because it looks like a regression in whatever changed most recently rather than an expiry.
//! The whole document goes, and the receiving machine mints its own sessions from the remember
//! token for the rest of its ~31 days.
//!
//! # Why only `--web`
//!
//! API tokens are deliberately not exportable. `GEA_TOKEN` with a scoped token created in the
//! web UI is already the better CI story, and an exported one would lose the `scopes` recorded
//! on the login — which is the only reason an `InsufficientScope` error can say what the token
//! actually has instead of `unknown`.
//!
//! # The two guards, and what they are protecting against
//!
//! This value authenticates the **whole account** for about a month and cannot be scoped the way
//! a token can. So export refuses a terminal unless forced — a full-account credential scrolling
//! into scrollback is how one ends up in a screen recording — and its warning goes to stderr,
//! never stdout, so `| gh secret set` stays a clean pipe.
