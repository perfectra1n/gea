//! Where tokens live: the OS keyring, `hosts.toml` at mode 0600, or an environment variable.
//!
//! ## Why the keyring needs this much care
//!
//! `keyring` 4.x's default backend on Linux is the D-Bus Secret Service. That backend
//! **fails on headless machines, inside containers, over SSH without a session, and in CI**
//! — which is precisely where a command-line tool spends most of its life. Worse, a broken
//! or half-started session bus does not fail fast: it can *block for seconds* while D-Bus
//! waits for a service activation that will never complete.
//!
//! So three mechanisms, each fixing a distinct failure:
//!
//! 1. **Keyring failure is a warning, never a crash.** [`Credentials::token`] falls through
//!    to the file and environment stores and records an [`ErrorKind::KeyringUnavailable`]
//!    for the caller to print. A CLI that refuses to run because the desktop keyring is
//!    absent is a CLI that cannot be used from a server.
//! 2. **A 2-second timeout** ([`KEYRING_TIMEOUT`]) around every keyring call, implemented by
//!    running it on a throwaway thread that is abandoned if it does not answer.
//! 3. **The outcome is cached per host** as `credential_store` in `hosts.toml`, so a machine
//!    with no Secret Service pays the failed round-trip once rather than on every invocation.
//!
//! `GEA_CREDENTIAL_STORE=env|file|keyring` is a hard override that skips all of the above,
//! which is what CI should set.
//!
//! ## The token is never logged
//!
//! Tokens are carried in [`secrecy::SecretString`], which redacts itself in `Debug` and
//! zeroes its buffer on drop. Any plain `String` a backend hands us (the keyring API returns
//! one, and so does `std::env::var`) is explicitly [`zeroize`]d after being copied, because
//! `String::into_boxed_str` may reallocate and leave the original bytes in freed heap memory.
//!
//! Every token is returned with a [`TokenSource`]. A 401 that can say *which* token was
//! rejected and *where it came from* — `GITEA_TOKEN` from the environment, versus the
//! keyring entry for a different login — is the difference between a one-line fix and an
//! afternoon.
