//! The web operations behind `gea project`, and the title→id resolution they all need.
//!
//! # Why every verb resolves a title
//!
//! Gitea's project routes are `/projects/{id}` and `/projects/{id}/{columnID}`. Nobody knows
//! that `Roadmap` is 3 or that its `Done` column is 12, and a command that demanded those
//! numbers would be `gea web` with extra steps. So each verb reads the index (or the board) and
//! maps the name the user typed onto the id the route wants.
//!
//! An **ambiguous** name is refused with the matches listed, never guessed. Gitea is perfectly
//! willing to hold two boards called `Roadmap`, exactly as it holds two milestones called `1.0`
//! — which real testing found, and which is why `gea milestone` established this rule first.
