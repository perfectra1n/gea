//! Layer 3: the hand-written, `gh`-shaped commands.
//!
//! Layer 2 (`gea raw`) already reaches all 506 operations, so a command belongs here only if
//! it is *nicer* than layer 2 — by inferring the repository, orchestrating several calls,
//! prompting when something is missing, or rendering better than pretty-printed JSON. See
//! `docs/porcelain-conventions.md`, which is binding.
//!
//! Each group owns one module and follows the same shape as [`crate::api`] and [`crate::raw`]:
//! a `run` that is synchronous on the outside and enters `runtime::block_on` internally, so no
//! caller has to care that the client is async.
//!
//! Plumbing that is genuinely common to every group — field tables, the
//! `--json`/`--jq`/`--template` triad, pagination caps, prompting, the stderr note — lives in
//! [`support`]. It exists because six groups each grew a private copy while this file was
//! frozen; see that module's docs. A helper that needs an `Issue`, a `PullRequest` or a `Label`
//! is domain code and stays with its group.
//!
//! Groups whose module still holds a stub answer with a "not implemented yet" that names the
//! `gea raw` command doing the same job. That is deliberate: every endpoint already works, so
//! an unimplemented porcelain command is a missing convenience, never a missing capability.
